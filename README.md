# password_checker

A simple password checker that only allows a password if it's 8 characters or more,
has a capital character and one numeric digit. The parameters for this project came from Automate the boring stuff with Python
by Al Sweigart.

### Skills Used
* Python
* Regex
* Recursion
* Conditional statements
* Functions
* Variables
  
### What I Learned
With this project I learned how to create a regex object using the re module and re.complie to create my own patterns to match for.
Also a bit of recursion with the main password checker function being called from within itself if a requirement for a strong password
is not met.
